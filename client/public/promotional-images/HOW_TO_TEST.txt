🎯 HOW TO TEST THE PROMOTIONAL POPUP
====================================

QUICK START (3 Steps):
----------------------

1. CREATE OR DOWNLOAD A TEST IMAGE
   - Create an image: 1080px × 1350px (recommended)
   - Or download a sample promotional poster online
   - Save it with one of these names:
     • offer.jpg
     • offer.png
     • promo.jpg
     • banner.jpg

2. PLACE THE IMAGE IN THIS FOLDER
   - Location: client/public/promotional-images/
   - Just drag and drop your image here
   - Make sure it's named correctly (offer.jpg, promo.png, etc.)

3. TEST ON YOUR WEBSITE
   - Start your development server: npm run dev
   - Open your website: http://localhost:3000
   - Wait 1-2 seconds
   - The popup should appear automatically!

TESTING THE CLOSE FUNCTIONALITY:
---------------------------------
✓ Click the X button (top-right) - popup closes
✓ Click outside the image - popup closes
✓ Refresh the page - popup won't show again (same session)
✓ Close browser and reopen - popup shows again (new session)

TO REMOVE THE POPUP:
--------------------
Simply delete or rename the image file from this folder.
No image = No popup!

RECOMMENDED TEST IMAGE SIZES:
-----------------------------
• Mobile First: 1080px × 1350px (9:16 ratio)
• Square: 1080px × 1080px
• Landscape: 1920px × 1080px (will auto-resize)

SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS:
-----------------------
✓ JPG/JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
✓ PNG (.png)
✓ WebP (.webp)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Popup not showing?
→ Check file name matches: offer.jpg, promo.png, etc.
→ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
→ Check browser console for errors (F12)
→ Make sure image is in the correct folder

Popup showing but image broken?
→ Check image file isn't corrupted
→ Try a different format (PNG instead of JPG)
→ Reduce file size (compress image)
